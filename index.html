              As Valentine's Day approaches, I find myself thinking about the incredible woman who has brought so much joy and love into the beginning of 2024, 
              and that is you. Your presence fills my days with happiness, and your caring and love have added a special warmth to my heart.

              I would like to ask you to go out with me on <br> February 15, 2024 @ Mall of ASIA? </p>

            <p>  We'll go there at lunchtime, watch a movie, go to the arcade, and 
              sit by the seaside to talk about whatever comes to our minds. <br>
              Wear whatever makes you comfortable and happy! </p>

            <p>I know you're an independent woman, but I'm sure you deserve to be treated like a princess as well. </p>
            <p> With all my love,</p>
            <p> Lance &hearts; </p>
